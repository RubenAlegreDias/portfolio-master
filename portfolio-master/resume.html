						<p class="resume-description1"><strong>Graphic Designer</strong><br /> My job consists to create all kinds of graphic material (stationaries, flyers, posters, t-shirt stamps, outdoors, roll ups, flags etc) as well as producing such materials. Also, the company is the owner of a local newspaper(Jornal O Ericeira), which I was the main designer. I was also in charge of a Online TV Channel (EriceiraTV) for which I created all the motion graphics, and was also the main editor. I worked here full time from January 2011 till September 2011, (the time I went to college), and kept working on weekends, to help with my income. After college I came back to occupy my last position, becoming the lead designer on the team after a few years.The company later changed its name to 100 Comparação.</p>

						<h2 class="resume-title1">Hi Interactive</h2>
						<p class="resume-description1"><strong>Digital Designer</strong><br /> Here I learned the basic of interfaces, how different it was from design for paper, and had my first experiences with prototyping tools and grids for different monitor sizes.This job was merely me asking designers to give me problems to solve, and trying to solve them, in manners to gain experience in other areas of design.It was an opportunity to my first contact with UI design, but mostly executed graphic assets for other designers. </p>
